            Accessing the Service and Account Security
        </h2>
        <p>
            You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to
            have access to the Service.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Creating an Account:
        </h3>
        <p>
            To access the Service or some of the resources it offers, you must
            register on the website. If you no longer have access to your
            grinnell.edu email address, you must email grinnellplans@gmail.com
            to set up your account. It is a condition of your use of the Service
            that all the information you provide when registering on the Service
            is accurate and complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to personal accounts, Users may request that the
            Administrators create publicly editable accounts for a specified
            purpose. These public accounts are generally meant to create a
            community space for particular topics or groups to share information
            and conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Administrators may refuse to provide you with an account for any
            reason or no reason. If the Administrators do provide you with an
            account, you will receive a user name and password.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Personal Account Security:
        </h3>
        <p>
            You are responsible for safeguarding the password associated with
            your personal account. We encourage you to change your temporary
            password that the Administrators provide to you to a different,
            secret password. We encourage you to use a &ldquo;strong&rdquo;
            password that use a combination of upper and lower case letters,
            symbols, and numbers. You also acknowledge that your account is
            personal to you and agree to take responsibility for Content posted
            to your plan by people to whom you have given access to your
            account. We encourage you not to provide any other person with
            access to this Service or portions of it using your user name and
            password. You agree to notify us immediately of any potentially
            malicious unauthorized access to or use of your user name or
            password or any other breach of security. You should use particular
            caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer
            so that others are not able to view or record your password or other
            personal information.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Public Account Security:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Where a user name and password has been created for a publicly
            editable Plan, that user name may only be used in connection with
            the intended purpose of the public account.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Privacy Settings
        </h3>
        <p>
            GP may offer the ability to control which other users of the Service
            have access to the Content you post on the Service. It is your
            responsibility to configure these settings. We do not guarantee the
            effectiveness of any controls offered. It is also your
            responsibility to select whether your Plan can be read by Guest
            Users.

            Appendix A: Investigation Procedure
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Investigation Procedure described below is a protocol for the
            investigation of concerns voiced by Users. The Grinnell Plans
            Administrators have identified these steps as a general roadmap for
            investigations in order to maximize fair and informed
            decision-making. But Admin are not bound to use the procedure. An
            investigation may deviate from it or disregard it in any
            investigation when circumstances, in Administrators&#39; discretion,
            warrant. Termination (or other administrative action) based on a
            violation of the Terms of Service may be effected without an
            investigation, or with an investigation conducted in some other
            fashion.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complaints are emailed to grinnellplans@gmail.com</li>
            <li>Plans Administrators open an investigation period, and allow
                individuals to confidentially voice their grievances in case
                incident is not isolated to an individual or group.</li>
            <li>Complainants and respondents are contacted and asked to share
                their side of the story. Our emails and the subsequent responses
                are archived.</li>
            <li>At the close of the comment period, a quorum (80%) of Grinnell
                Administrators discuss grievances, evidence provided, and if
                needed, contacts a legal representative to advise.</li>
            <li>Administrators discuss short term, medium term, and long term
                solutions.</li>
            <li>At the end of meetings, an email containing the minutes of that
                meeting are disseminated to the Administrators. Those minutes
                are confidential, and are not shared with either the complainant
                or respondent.</li>
            <li>The same quorum (80%) of Administrators makes a collective
                decision based off of information that is available that best

            Appendix B: Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
        </h2>
        <p>
            It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright
            infringement. This page describes the information that should be
            present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices
            of alleged infringement to GrinnellPlans as straightforward as
            possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that
            are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of
            notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the
            United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which
            can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site,
            http://www.copyright.gov) but we will respond to notices of this
            form from other jurisdictions as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under
            local country law or United States law, our response to these
            notices may include removing or disabling access to material claimed
            to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating
            subscribers. If we remove or disable access in response to such a
            notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or
            administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make
            a counter notification. We may also document notices of alleged
            infringement on which we act. As with all legal notices, a copy of
            the notice may be sent to one or more third parties who may make it
            available to the public.

            Infringement Notification:
        </h3>
        <p>
            To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written
            communication by email to grinnellplans@gmail.com that sets forth
            the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for
            damages (including costs and attorneys&#39; fees) if you materially
            misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your
            copyrights. Indeed, in a recent case (please see
            http://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold/ for more
            information), a company that sent an infringement notification
            seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair
            use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees. The
            company agreed to pay over $100,000. If you are uncertain whether
            material available online infringes your copyright, consult your
            attorney.

                sites. Posts must be referenced by the permalink of the post.
                For example, &ldquo;The copyrighted work at issue is the text

            <li>Identify the material that you claim is infringing the
